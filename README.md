## Overview and origin
* [Enlitic](https://enlitic.com/)
* Jeremy Howard and Kevin Lyman founded Enlitic
* The founder of Enlitic, Jeremy Howard, stated in an interview that throughout his studies of medical deep learning he saw a plethora of opportunities in the medical field to use Ai to better healthcare,
    >Most importantly, the opportunities have the potential to save lives, and greatly reduce healthcare costs.
he felt this is where help is needed the most. 
* Enlitic is funded by Capitol Health, Thorney Investment Group, and other institutions. The company recieved 25 million dollars in funding on their last financing round and 55 million dollars overall. 

## Business Activities 
* Enlitic designs Ai software to help doctors and radiologists all over the world in diagnosing patients more quickly and efficiently and aims to improve the accuracy of diagnosing patients.
* The market size for Enlitic's technology is large since it is crucial to different groups in the healthcare industry. The company's digital marketing manager stated that their biggest customers are executives, radiologists, and Picture Archive and Communication System administrators. Each of these groups need the technology offered by Enlitic for different reasons, although radiologists are the ones that benefit from the technology the most.  
* While there are many companies that introduce Ai to healthcare, there are not many approved Ai programs for patient diagnosis. Enlitic combines patient data with Ai to improve diagnostic efficiency and diagnose diseases earlier than doctors would without its software. When asked about Enlitic, Dr. Jinzaki expressed that Enlitic's software seems to be effective since it has shown to be highly accurate. He also expressed that using Ai for diagnosing X-rays is important since the diagnostic accuracy of X-rays is low, which leads to a higher risk of missing medical problems in patients. Dr. Jinzaki stated that any improvement on the accuracy of X-ray diagnosis would be significantly important. Enlitic's efficiency and focus on X-rays helps it stay on top of the industry. 
* Enlitic uses curie|ENDEX and curie|ENCOG each of those programs improves radiologists’ experiences in different aspects. curie|ENDEX is used to standardize medical imaging data which helps reduce time spent on tasks and eases workflow. The data taken is classified in a way that the relevant clinical information is readily available and can be easily sent to whoever needs it. Another program that Enlitic uses is curie|ENCOG which anonymizes Protected Health Information (PHI) while keeping important clinical data regarding the patient’s condition. Both technologies are able to increase the accuracy of diagnosing patients because the clinical data from previous patients is saved in the database which has helped in detecting health issues earlier in many cases since Ai software was able to detect abnormalities in new images by referencing previous abnormalities it has come across before. It was also been able to notice signs of disease much faster than doctors since the software is able to catch small changes in patients that doctors would not be able to see.

## Landscape 
* Enlitic is in the healthcare technology field.
* Some major innovations in healthcare technology are early disease detection, image and data analyses, and it has been improving clinical trials and research.
* Some other major companies in healthcare technology are Aidoc, Lunit, and Caption Healthcare. 

## Results
* With the surge of AI in the medical industry, Enlitic is has began to shift its focus to data standarization to better the quality of data in order to increase the efficiency of diagnostics in the long run. Enlitic was able to create a partnership with TMC which is a large radiology reading group based in Europe and other healthcare organizations. 
* Enlitic's success can be seen in the percentage increase of accuracy improvement in diagnosing medical images, its algorithm improved accuracy for radiologists by 50-70% and at a very high speed. Detection of disease was also increased by 50%. 
* Enlitic was expecting to take over the global volume for medical imaging by 95% and currently has access to more than 10 million cases in its database which makes it one of the largest databases in the world compared to its competitors. 

## Recommendations
* Enlitic is performing very well in the medical imaging field. It can expand its algorthim to be able to collect data and spot abnormalities in other approaches such as biopsies and medical samples. It could also expand into utilizing Ai to deliver or suggest treatment plans based on previous data collected from patients' cases to doctors. The Ai company would be able to utilize its data collection approach through its existing software in both scenarios.
* Enlitic expanding its algorithm's diagnostic abilities to other approaches would greatly expand its customer base across more healthcare fields. Using its data to suggest treatment plans will make the company's software useful to healthcare workers in more than one way which will create an even higher demand for it. 
* curie|ENDEX and curie|ENCOG which are the technologies that are already in use by Enlitic could both be utilized for both services. 
* Both software programs ENDEX and ENCOG are what is needed to collect important patient data and keep the patient information safe for such services, they have already proved in being effective and efficient in helping healthcare workers in diagnosis. One thing that can be added is the treament plan and results used for patients to help with the treatment plan suggestion.
